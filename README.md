# Orchard FED Test

This repository contains a web application developed for the Orchard FED Test. The application includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files organized to display images and text blocks with animations.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web pages.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file responsible for handling user interactions and animations.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for the application.
- `assets/`: Directory containing image assets used in the application.
- `dist/`: Directory where bundled and optimized files are generated by webpack.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Fundamental technologies for web development.
- **Bootstrap**: Framework utilized for its extensive UI components and responsive design utilities.
- **Animate.css**: Library for easily adding CSS animations to elements without writing custom animations.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler used for managing dependencies, asset optimization, and development server.
- **jQuery**: Library for simplified DOM manipulation and event handling, particularly useful for legacy browser support.
